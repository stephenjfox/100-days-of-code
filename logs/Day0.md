### Day 0: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Preping for the 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:** I've got a few programming languages that I want to level up in, so here they are and how I'm going to give them a boost:

I'm expecting to do a TodoMVC in AngularDart, some small concurrency experiments with Clojure. Maybe a library will fall out of these exercises, but I'm more doubtful: both Dart and Clojure have such strong core libraries as it stands. Javascript, on the other hand, is a "require"-party, but I think I'll write my own. Something like a functional programming core library, written in ES6 (all the good ones are &lt;ES5)
