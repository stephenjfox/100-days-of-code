## New Book List

- [Site Reliability Engineering](g.co/SREBook) - by SREs (former and current) at Google
- [JavaScript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read)
  - A broad, blended, and passionately written work covering "programming with functions" with Javascript as a lens.
  - The book starts with "basics" but I have an endorsement from [Eric Elliott](https://twitter.com/_ericelliott) that there's much to learn for anyone who works in JS.
- [Setting Up ES6](https://leanpub.com/setting-up-es6/read)
  - ES6 (sans modules) is basically [supported in all browsers](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/), but not in Node or most of it's tool
  - Namely, [Gulp](https://css-tricks.com/transpiling-es6/), Grunt, and WebPack 1 don't know what to do with ES6-standard Javascript. So we need to compile it with Babel (because [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) kind of sucks and doesn't get updated).

Everything else I've been reading has been put on hold, because these are books of principles and largely applicable technologies. The others were more directed application of a given language.
I want to be a principled man.

### Day 22: February 22, 2017

Omissions addressed in the [blog](https://medium.com/@sjf96).

Dang it CSS is frustrating. I __know__ it, but when I go to execute I'm stopped at the door. Take for example, centering an element horizontally. To the CSS novice, this seems like a complex and mystical thing that should be relatively straight forward (would a style like "align: center" make sense?) and yet aludes one.

Then, they wander into this little nugget `margin: 0 auto; /* centers element */` and you think you're the freaking Wizard of Oz... Has __never__ worked for me in a CodePen, and that's the project requirement for these Free Code Camp challenges.

I'm an engineer, who gets off on making things work. I'll be the first to admit. But when one exercises the enumeration of possible state combinations and none produce the desired result, you find yourself quite agitated. This is what has occurred this evening working with horizontal centering with my cascaded styles.

___Aside___
We should really find another way to write for the web. HTML and CSS were meant for static documents of the 90's. It's almost 2020.
___End Aside___

[10 minutes post rant] I read [this](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/), so I hope I can execute on that...



### Day 23: February 23, 2017

Typing that is going to feel a little redundant for the rest of the month (the days are the same).

This Local Weather app is giving me a surprising amount of trouble. I have this beautiful vision in my head, and nary the skills to create that from scratch. Haven't been coerced into using libraries for the majority of my career, I've simple short on practice. Very far behind the 10,000-some odd hours to be an expert in something; whereas with Java, that's a different matter...

So here I am, fumbling about. Strong CSS principles and vision in mind. My hand drawing skills are rather bad at getting my imagination onto paper, but I know what I want to app to look like: Material, through and through.

__A Goal__: To have the page color scheme change with the weather. I.e. "Snowy" weather is white, gray, and blues. "Hot" weather is red, tan, orange. etc.

Tonight, I've already recorded almost two hours of work and the page is still, _roughly_ the same ugliness it was last night: a bit of logical over complication and strict adherence to principles slowed me down.

[10 minutes later] BEM. I appreciate the flat approach to everything. It removes dependencies and, as such, allows one to think about things independently of one another. "If I was just working with X, what would I need to do to change it?" That's the idea anyway. So each specialized class has just a few lines that describe exactly what you want to happen and nothing else - because nothing else is effecting the class, is it? Highest specificity wins in the land of CSS selectors.

I'm struggling with how to box the icon for the weather (a mandatory feature). If I house the image in a box, is that unnecessary boxing of HTML primitives? Or should I put the image in a box, style the box, and then further style the image?

You know what? After reading that, it sounds silly to do the latter. Thanks.

Since I'm going for a Material-theme, I want minimal margin with substantial padding. I'm sure [the basics](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/) will help me!

[Another 15 minutes later] I love CSS variables. And color palette pickers like [Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com). They help me hone the vision.

Reread [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/3-questions-to-watch-out-for-in-a-javascript-interview-725012834ccb#.m5sanrpyd) to remember JavaScript event delegation patterns, so I don't have runaway Function objects polluting my heap.

Feature completion feels pretty good.


### Day 24: February 24, 2017

I'm starting really late today (it's 11PM), so I'll just be squeezing things in. Flat UI is where I want to go; the "Material" label has been clouding my vision.

I've got my HTML organized fairly well, along with BEM styles to boot. Being sick is making it a huge pain to just sit down in this chair and code.

##### 11:15 PM

So horizontally centering an element is `margin: 0 auto;`, but what's vertical centering? Likewise, it's `margin: auto 0;`. But that's a weird thing to achieve.

After a bunch of fiddling, I've settled on a box height for the main view of 66.5%. This is what works best on my iPhone 7+, so now I'm going to test it elsewhere.
Building mobile first is just that: test on a mobile device, and make sure things scale.

On desktop, this sizing is too much. I think it has to do with my `height` measurements compensating for the CodePen banner.

##### 11:38 PM

Messing with the view port took a view. CodePen magnifies the port significantly. Time to start playing with font sizes (it was on the list anyway).

##### 11:56 PM

Aligning the left side of the text of my "latitude" and "longitude" fields with the "weather content" box's left wall is kind of tough. I'm not certain where the "centering" of text takes place in regards to this

##### 12:06 PM

There is a runaway element styling on my page. The footer isn't receiving any styles, so I'm probably going to ditch it.

##### 12:16 PM

Following the Material Design (I know, I know) rules for pixel sizing, using multiples of 8px and 16px.

##### 12:23 PM

I'll be giving it a rest for the night. My brain will organize my thoughts into clarity while I sleep and I'll have something structured to say for the blog post.

Maybe I should just put the button back, instead of trying to be clever with clicking the temperature units...


### Day 25: February 25, 2017

##### 11:26 PM

I think I'm on a mission to prove to myself that I can jog in CSS circles forever. Between adherence to strict [BEM rules](https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/) and stateless JavaScript, I'm working overtime on some really simple stuff.

Look here. The Local Weather app is done, in effect. 

- [x] Icon for the weather (free from Apixu)
- [x] Local temperature on page load
- [x] Click-a-thing to toggle Fahrenheit/Celsius.

It's just not good looking. I would think that making a modern, flat UI for such a simple app would be more simple. Obviously mistaken.

I just remembered a border-decoration (or something like that) to use on `button` to get it looking flat. :) Let's see what I can get up to in a few minutes...

##### 11:40 PM

Screw it. I'm using the Material Design visual template and attempting a re-create (almost like [the guide from p1xt](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-computer-science-and-web-development-comprehensive-path/64470))

##### 11:53 PM

It's a lot cleaner now, but the UI doesn't match a phone very well. The magnified view from CodePen is totally throwing me off.

At this point, I need to adjust things like `background` and `width` to get the fill color-correct.

##### 12:04 AM (next day)

I've scrapped `margin` and `padding` because they were just playing me in a weird place on the screen. Almost identical to the [material palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/blue-grey/light-blue) sample, but the gratuitous white space needs addressing.

I'm going to blog, then we'll catch up tomorrow.


### Day 26: February 26, 2017

Codes for Jesus (thanks Bro Science)! I'm giving myself an hour to get the view to look decent enough for my tastes. I'm fiddling with the height and verticle-centering, while listening to K-pop, so I can just have this done.

27 minutes. I'm calling it. I'm conceptually stuck at this point, but it looks ok. There's not a ton of content to style around, so I've got limited resources to design. That's an excuse. I'm really just unsure of where to go from here, to ask the right questions.

The CSS that I'm writing isn't giving me the desired result of a "main content" with a fixed size. Instead, the main content block snaps to a new size once its content is hydrated (loaded). It's very upsetting. Maybe I'll have something later.
Making use of blank space is something I need to master, because the next app is a Wikipedia viewer: a small scale search engine, that I'm planning to do a "master-detail" setup for.

On small devices (width &lt;600px) the plan is to use a completely different set of styles, which I think is how it is supposed to always be done. I'm going to Material palette again for the color scheme, but everyone knows Wikipedia is black-white-and-gray-scale.

You know what? I just thought that I could have the cohort (Chingu-Penguins, Gen. 1) peer critique it and help me make it better. I know it's not beautiful. Or maybe I should just keep going, get my cert, then come back for seconds after my skills have improved? Who knows?


### Day 27: February 27, 2017

##### 10:16 PM

This whole blog-once-every-two-days thing is really weird. Why not just get those posts out daily?

Today I spent an hour and change try to coax a "compose" function into life. So far, I've had limited success:

- While I'm able to create a function that composes on two and three inputs, moving to a functional reduce doesn't provide a compliant solution.

Worse yet, I've had the algorithm for at iterative implementation in my head all afternoon. But see, when it comes to being principled, I'm a stictler (and occasional asshole) on the inside.

Hang on a sec. I'm going to try it out. My pride isn't that great.

##### 10:26 PM

Yup. It works. Like a charm. And now I know how to do it with reduce... -\_- Teaching myself is both boring and fascinating sometimes.

##### 10:29 PM

It's just that easy kids. Now I need to handle edge cases, like 0 and 1 functions. Then it's good for a pretty little bow

##### 10:38 PM

Dang it. I knew I was doing something off. Compose consumes right to left, such that the definition is more human readable.

Ex:

```
// just some setup to get you thinking in code again.
const head = (array) => array[0];
const toUpperCase = (string) => string.toUpperCase();
const reverse = (array) => array.reverse(); // imagine Array.prototype.reverse() isn't an in-place operation, for brevity

const last = compose(head, reverse);
```

You can read the definition of "last" as "the head of the reversed list". The way I wrote my compose (consuming left to right) it reads more like "reverse the list, then take its 'head' element".

This reads a lot more like "how" to do something, rather than "what" to do (which is what functional programming is all about).

Lessons learned for the future.


### Day 29: March 1, 2017

##### 10:28 PM

I still haven't finished writing about the machine learning meetup from yesterday. Hopefully, this doesn't spoiler it too much.

That's the __real__ trouble with this challenge: the posting to social media. My life is far removed from social networking, that having a visible commitment on something that I've extracted from my life... It's like going to my ex-girlfriend's for dinner. I might get fed, but it's not very enjoyable.

I love the coding. And I'm definitely getting better at writing by blogging (almost) everyday. It's just a weird problem to have: "I need to say all these things. Online. When I know that I've done them. That all said, having to perform for people does get a different result out of me.
I'm just whining at this point.

##### 10:32 PM

Algorithms. Of the practical variety. I'm implementing a point-free-form "compose" function. The version I had the other day required that you think from the bottom-up, and this version works from the top down.

I personally like the top-down approach, because it's a touch more declarative and reads "matter of fact"-ly. If you want _something_, you state what that something is.

To re-use an earlier example: "I want the last element in a list... What's the 'last' element, you say? Well, I suppose, if we were looking from the other end, it would be the very first one." And, again, telling the computer the how - "spin the list around, then give me the first thing you find" - is practically imperative.

__The bug I've got__ right now is strange: `String.prototype.length` isn't returning its length, but instead is returning itself. I must have misdefined something, so I'm going to type them back out.

##### 10:46 PM

Thanks to the REPL, I figured it out. Then it was just some tweaking. I'm going to leave the variable names length and self-documenting, because it should be that way.

##### 11:06 PM

Done. Chat with y'all tomorrow.

### Day 30: March 3, 2017

Reading the [30 Days of React book](https://www.fullstackreact.com/30-days-of-react/)(by the [FullStack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/) crew). I used to take notes while reading, so I'll do that here.

__Lesson 01__: "Look how cool it is to have HTML in a script tag!!!" -\_\_- I'm not impressed. I've read the book before, so I know it gets better. Just a bumpy start.

__Lesson 02__:

Okay, cool. We're using ES6 classes (maybe that's why I put it down the last time?). A brief explanation of what the transipling process (I learned this during a conference talk, so the repetition is pushing me to the "burden of knowledge" territory).

"Tune in next time to actually start writing some code" :P Sure thing, [Ari](https://twitter.com/auser)

__Lesson 03__:

Something that's really _awesome_ about this book is that he starts with a "browser-first" approach. You can put the code on a server, and you __will__ see that "Hello World". It's a nice touch. I think I'll hop in now.

I've initialized a local Git repo, with just a single `index.html` file in it.

[7 minutes, 40s later] Took me a bit to type out the html, check the cdn's, and fix typos. It's neat that this "just works".
- Page speed: First (meaningful) paint in 250ms. That's hot sauce.

I'm taking a second to read about [React v15.4](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/11/16/react-v15.4.0.html).

I'm settled that Atom (the editor) has better coloring for React development. If only I could get Ctrl+DEL working better...

Read [this](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-without-es6.html) in protest of ES6 classes :P I'll learn it anyway, becaus e that's what my side-project team is going to be using.

I should have a Git repo for this... 10 minutes of fighting with Windows, SSH keys, and GitHub...


__Lesson 04__:

I just learned something I __REALLY__ didn't want to learn this evening, and lost 2 hours because I was letting it disturb my inner peace.

https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34638462/using-git-with-ssh-agent-on-windows

And remember if you set a password on an SSH key. I spent just an hour trying to figure out why the key wouldn't get added to the agent. The whole time, `posh-git` was just failing silently on the lack of a password for the key.

----

And now to start the lesson.

...

Funny enough, he starts referencing CSS in the code, but doesn't include a stylesheet link. Time to check the official blog...

He's pulling in Boostrap (the enemy) and what not. It's okay with me.

What's the deal with loading? I'll figure that out when I get back.

----

On Day 31, I wrote React code and left the land of tutorials.

Days 31-35 are further summarized [on Medium](https://medium.com/@foxjstephen)

I've been unnecessarily - and unfulfillingly - long winded in my posts, so I'm trying to cut back.

The goal is to be as concise as [this guy](https://github.com/Kornil/100-days-of-code/blob/master/logs/log_61-80.md)

### Day 36: March 9, 2017

##### 8:40 PM

Tonight, I attended an Android developers' meetup. Plenty of good content, and I even got to help someone with a bug.

Unfortunately, I remembered why I don't code Android anymore: 

Everything's a hack.

I went because I was hopeful for the opportunity to meant Googler's that were recruiter (I've heard they attend meetups to find talent).
How caddy is that? Then again, I've got to do what's best for my career. Give myself as many chances to be in the right place at the right time.

Needless to say, there was no recruiter and I wasn't thrilled about the hacking-heap of code that is becoming the [Android Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index.html)
- I think I'm just going to be done with Android for a while
- At least until Google is further behind [Flutter](https://flutter.io)


##### 8:48 PM

I'm going to re-read the instructions for that Promise challenge, and see if I can crack it.
- It would be fun to take on the challenge before my evening settles into spiritual reflection, scriptural study, and meditation.

##### 9:08 PM

So I logicized that bonus question is simply "implement Promise.any() and display thumbnails of those that completed".
- This is insanely complicated, and the solution I would throw together would be much more complicated that necessary.
- I recommend studying [Josh Kramer's solution](http://www.effectiveui.com/blog/2014/11/11/promise-any-a-missing-use-case/). It's very concise and well documented.

I'm going to pull together a few more resources for Machine Learning.

Probably won't get much work in tomorrow - unless I cheat and do it in the middle of work. Attending another play.
- Hopefully, this boredom and disappointment isn't me quinching my own flame. Maybe Android is just _that_ depressing to me now.
